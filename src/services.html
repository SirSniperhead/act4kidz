These include movement skills, play skills, and many of the skills needed for school readiness. Occupational therapists work with children, young people, their families and their communities to enhance their ability to engage in the activities that they want to, need to, or are expected to do, or by modifying the activities or the environment to allow for better engagement and participation.</p>
					<p><strong>Psychological services</strong></p>
					<p>Psychologists assess and support children and families with concerns about general development and learning, social and emotional skills, behavioural difficulties and relationships.  Psychologists can work with children, young people, their families, and other important adults in their lives (e.g., schools), to manage and respond to traumatic experiences.</p>

    				<p>The Early Education Program (EEP) is a unique pre-school educational intervention service for children who struggle to attain skills necessary to start school as a result of abuse or neglect.</p>
					<p>The Townsville, Brisbane and Cairns program was developed through a partnership between Act for Kids and Education Queensland. The teachers are a part of the Townsville, Brisbane and Cairns teams and work closely with practitioners in these centres to integrate interventions specific to individual children into the curriculum.</p>
					<p>The EEP is open four days a week and children aged 2–5 years attend full or half days at the pre-school learning the skills they need for primary school.</p>
					<p><strong>How Can the Early Education Program help?</strong></p>
					<p>A registered teacher develops individual learning plans for each child to ensure they reach their full potential. Children also receive support from a multi-disciplinary team of practitioners that can include psychologists, speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists, nurses, social workers and like disciplines. The program works with the parents, caregivers and other family members to help ensure the child is safe and happy and that they experience positive early development and interventions.</p>

					<p>Act for Kids operates a safe house in Doomadgee. It is expected we will transition control and management of the program to the traditional owners. Due to the success of the safe houses in the Cape and Gulf, Act for Kids was also asked to set up an additional safe house in Cairns.</p>
